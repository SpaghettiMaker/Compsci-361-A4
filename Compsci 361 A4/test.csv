1,"in a previous work all three components of comamonas testosteroni b-356 biphenyl bphchlorobiphenyls pcbs dioxygenase dox have been purified and characterized they include an iron-sulphur protein ispbph which is the terminal oxygenase composed of two subunits encoded by bpha and bphe a ferredoxin ferbph encoded by bphf and a reductase redbph encoded by bphg bphg is not located in the neighbourhood of bphaef in b-356 we are reporting the cloning of b-356-bphg and the sequencing of b-356-bph dox genes comparative analysis of the genes provided genetic evidence showing that two bph dox lineages have emerged in gram-negative bacteria the main features of the lineage that includes b-356 are the location of bphg outside the bph gene cluster and the structure of redbph which is very distinct from all other aryl dioxygenase-reductases"
2,"we compared morphology of two geographically close populations of the tropical lizard tropidurus hispidus to test the hypothesis that habitat structure influences the evolution of morphology and ecology at the population level t hispidus isolated on a rock outcrop surrounded by tropical forest use rock crevices for refuge and appear dorsoventrally compressed compared with those in open savanna a principal components analysis revealed that the populations were differentially distributed along an axis representing primarily three components of shape body width body height and hind-leg length morphological divergence was supported by a principal components analysis of size-free morphological variables mitochondrial dna sequences of atpase 6 indicate that these populations are closely related relative to other t hispidus the rock outcrop morphology and ecology are derived within t hispidus and morphological and ecological divergence has occurred more rapidly than genetic divergence this suggests that natural selection can rapidly adjust morphology and ecology in response to a recent history of exposure to habitats differing in structure a result heretofore implied from comparative studies among lizard species"
3,"factor xiii mr 320000 is a blood coagulation factor that stabilizes and strengthens the fibrin clot it circulates in blood as a tetramer composed of two a subunits mr 75000 each and two b subunits mr 80000 each the b subunit consists of 641 amino acids and includes 10 tandem repeats of 60 amino acids known as gp-i structures short consensus repeats scr or sushi domains in the present study the human gene for the b subunit has been isolated from three different genomic libraries prepared in lambda phage fifteen independent phage with inserts coding for the entire gene were isolated and characterized by restriction mapping southern blotting and dna sequencing the gene was found to be 28 kilobases in length and consisted of 12 exons i-xii separated by 11 intervening sequences the leader sequence was encoded by exon i while the carbonyl-terminal region of the protein was encoded by exon xii exons ii-xi each coded for a single sushi domain suggesting that the gene evolved through exon shuffling and duplication the 12 exons in the gene ranged in size from 64 to 222 base pairs while the introns ranged in size from 87 to 9970 nucleotides and made up 92 of the gene the introns contained four alu repetitive sequences one each in introns a e i and j a fifth alu repeat was present in the flanking 3' end of the gene two partial kpni repeats were also found in the introns including one in intron i and one in intron j the kpni repeat in intron j was 89 homologous to a sequence of approximately 2200 nucleotides flanking the gene coding for human beta globin and approximately 3800 nucleotides from the l1 insertion present in the gene for human factor viii intron h also contained an o family repeat while two potential regions for z-dna were identified within introns g and j one nucleotide change was found in the coding region of the gene when its sequence was compared to that of the cdna this difference however did not result in a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein"
4,"we report the characterisation of a human gene designated mcg18 multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 candidate gene 18 that encodes a new member of the dnaj family of proteins database searches indicate that mcg18 also has the locus name hspf2 mcg18 lies 250bp centromeric of the vrfvegfb gene on chromosome 11q13 the mcg18 cdna is predicted to encode a 241 amino acid product that has partial homology to escherichia coli dnaj in that it contains the j domain however mcg18 has greatest similarity to a functionally undefined protein from caenorhabditis elegans both of which are predicted to have a membrane-spanning region adjacent to their j domains the cdna encoding the murine homolog mcg18 was also cloned and sequenced and the encoded protein shares 81 similarity to mcg18 the coding region of mcg18 is interrupted by 4 introns and the mrna is expressed as a 14kb message in all tissues examined including those derived from the breast ovary bladder lung and keratinocytes"
5,"fat tissue plays a critical role in the regulation of energy metabolism here we report the proteomic identification of a novel fat tissue-specific low molecular weight protein falp which responds to insulin falp is preferentially expressed in adipocytes but not in preadipocytes as shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis northern blot analysis shows that the falp gene is predominantly expressed in brown and white fat tissues but not in any other tissues examined human homologs of mouse falp are found to exist as two alternatively spliced isoforms which share the same n-terminus but have different c-termini both human and mouse falp contain a conserved putative transmembrane domain immunofluorescent analyses of 3t3-l1 adipocytes show that falp protein strictly localizes at a compact perinuclear membrane compartment treatment of cells with insulin induces the redistribution of falp into numerous discrete spotty structures spreading throughout the cytoplasm whereas the function of falp is currently unclear its tissue specific expression and the responsiveness to insulin suggest that falp might be involved in a process specifically restricted to adipose tissue function such as vesicular transport and protein secretion"
6,"mammalian cells obtain nucleic acid precursors through the de novo synthesis of nucleotides and the salvage of exogenous nucleobases and nucleosides the first step in the salvage pathway is transport across the plasma membrane several transport activities including equilibrative and concentrative mechanisms have been identified by their functional properties we report here the functional cloning of a 26-kilobase pair human cdna encoding the nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside nbmpr-insensitive equilibrative nucleoside transporter ei by functional complementation of the transport deficiency in a subline of cem human leukemia cells expression of this cdna conferred an nbmpr-insensitive sodium-independent nucleoside transport activity to the cells that exhibited substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity characteristic of the ei transporter the cdna contained a single open reading frame that encoded a 456-residue protein with 11 potential membrane-spanning regions and two consensus sites for n-glycosylation in the first predicted extracellular loop the predicted protein was 50 identical to the recently cloned human nbmpr-sensitive equilibrative nucleoside transporter ent1 and thus was designated ent2 surprisingly the carboxyl-terminal portion of the ent2 protein was nearly identical to a smaller protein in the genbanktm data base human hnp36 326 residues that has been identified as a growth factor-induced delayed early response gene of unknown function comparison of the ent2 and hnp36 nucleotide sequences suggested that hnp36 was translated from a second start codon within the ent2 open reading frame transient expression studies with the full-length ent2 and a 5'-truncated construct that lacks the first start codon predicted protein 99 identical to hnp36 demonstrated that only the full-length construct conferred uridine transport activity to the cells these data suggest that the delayed early response gene hnp36 is a truncated form of ent2 and that the full-length open reading frame of ent2 is required for production of a functional plasma membrane ei transporter"
